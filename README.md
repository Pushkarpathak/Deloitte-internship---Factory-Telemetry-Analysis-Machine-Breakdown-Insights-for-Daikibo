# Factory Telemetry Analysis: Machine Breakdown Insights for Daikibo

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **one month of telemetry data (May 2021)** collected from Daikibo’s four global factories:

* 🏭 **Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)**
* 🏭 **Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)**
* 🏭 **Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)**
* 🏭 **Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)**

Each factory operates **9 types of machines**, sending telemetry messages every **10 minutes**. Using this data, the goal is to answer two critical business questions:

1. **Which factory experienced the most machine breakdowns?**
2. **Within that factory, which machine types broke down most often?**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Parse and clean unified telemetry JSON data.
* Identify machine breakdown events.
* Aggregate and compare breakdown counts across factories.
* Drill down into the worst-performing factory to find high-risk machine types.
* Provide clear **visualizations** and **actionable insights**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas` → Data cleaning & analysis
  * `matplotlib / seaborn` → Visualization
  * `json` → Parsing input data

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Load Data** → Import JSON, inspect structure, validate timestamps.
2. **Define Breakdown** → Identify breakdown events from status/error fields.
3. **Aggregate Data**

   * Breakdown counts per factory.
   * Breakdown counts per machine type (in worst factory).
4. **Visualization** → Generate comparison plots.
5. **Insights & Recommendations** → Highlight factories/machines needing priority maintenance.

---

## 📈 Expected Outputs

* **Bar chart** showing breakdown counts across factories.
* **Machine-level chart** for the factory with the highest breakdowns.
* **Summary report** highlighting maintenance priorities.
